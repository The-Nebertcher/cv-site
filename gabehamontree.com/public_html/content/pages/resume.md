## Summary 
I have been working in the IT field for many years now starting from the most humble beginnings as a Comcast business technical support representative to Linux administrator for one of the largest defense contractors in the USA.  How did I get here?  Lots of missing out and taking the harder and often times not so fun route in my early twenties.  Spending long nights on homework or doing off hours development and research for the benefit of cause.  I wouldn't change any of it for the world though.
